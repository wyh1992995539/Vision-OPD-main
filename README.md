## Overview

Vision-OPD is a regional-to-global on-policy self-distillation framework that transfers a model's own privileged regional perception to its full-image policy, enabling fine-grained visual understanding in a single forward pass — without external teachers, ground-truth labels, reward verifiers, or inference-time tool use.

## Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n vision-opd python=3.12 -y
conda activate vision-opd
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . --no-deps
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
pip install causal-conv1d==1.6.1 --no-build-isolation
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Deployment

Serve the merged checkpoint with vLLM, for example:

```bash
vllm serve yuanqianhao/Vision-OPD-9B \
    --gpu-memory-utilization 0.85 \
    --tensor-parallel-size 8 \
    --served-model-name Vision-OPD-9B \
    --trust-remote-code
```

The server listens on port 8000 by default. You can then query the model via the OpenAI-compatible API at `http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions`.

Please check out our [Hugging Face Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/yuanqianhao/vision-opd) for all public Vision-OPD checkpoints.

### 2. Evaluation

Evaluate the deployed model on fine-grained visual benchmarks:

```bash
API_BASE="http://localhost:8000/v1/" \
OPENAI_MODEL_ID="Vision-OPD-9B" \
JUDGE_API_BASE="YOUR_JUDGE_API_BASE" \
JUDGE_MODEL="YOUR_JUDGE_MODEL_NAME" \
BENCHMARK="vstar,zoombench,hrbench-4k,hrbench-8k,mme-realworld,mme-realworld-cn" \
bash eval/run_eval.sh
```

Supported benchmarks: `vstar`, `zoombench`, `hrbench-4k`, `hrbench-8k`, `mme-realworld`, `mme-realworld-cn`, `mme-realworld-lite`, `visualprobe`, `mmvp`, `cv-bench`, `mmstar`, `pope`.

The evaluation script runs inference via the OpenAI-compatible API. Judge configuration can be set via `JUDGE_API_BASE` / `JUDGE_MODEL_PATH` environment variables. We use `openai/gpt-oss-120b` as the judge model. Other powerful models like Qwen3.5 or closed-source models are also recommended.

To evaluate Qwen3.5 models as baselines, set `ENABLE_THINKING=False` to run in non-thinking mode, for example:

```bash
API_BASE="http://localhost:8000/v1/" \
OPENAI_MODEL_ID="Qwen3.5-9B" \
ENABLE_THINKING=False \
JUDGE_API_BASE="YOUR_JUDGE_API_BASE" \
JUDGE_MODEL="YOUR_JUDGE_MODEL_NAME" \
BENCHMARK="vstar,zoombench,hrbench-4k,hrbench-8k,mme-realworld,mme-realworld-cn" \
bash eval/run_eval.sh
```

## Training

### 1. Prepare Training Data

Download and preprocess the [Vision-OPD-6K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuanqianhao/Vision-OPD-6K) dataset:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_data.py --data-dir ./data
```

This downloads images and metadata from HuggingFace, extracts archives, and converts `train.jsonl` to the parquet format expected by the training pipeline.

### 2. Training

Launch Vision-OPD training:

```bash
bash scripts/run_vision_opd.sh
```

Key hyperparameters can be edited at the top of the script. See the script for the full configuration.

### 3. Merge Checkpoints

After training, merge the FSDP-sharded checkpoint into a standard HuggingFace model:

```bash
bash scripts/merge_checkpoint.sh <path_to_checkpoint>
```

For example:

```bash
bash scripts/merge_checkpoint.sh ./checkpoints/Vision-OPD-Qwen3.5-4B/global_step_65/
```

This merges the FSDP actor shards, saves the model weights, config, tokenizer, and processor into the specified directory. The merged checkpoint can then be loaded directly with `transformers` or served with vLLM.
